## Usage

> __Environment Variables__ GitBud has hardcoded a username of 'neo4j' and a password of 'neo' for neo4j. You can change these in the code or override them by setting the appropriate environment variables. You will also need a GitHub Client ID and Client Secret to use the GitHub API. These, too, are set as environment variables. We have used the .env package, which allows environment variables to be set easily with the .env file in the root directory of the project. An example of the necessary variables for GitBud been provided here in this repo.
